## Features

- **RESTful API:** The backend provides a RESTful API to facilitate communication with the frontend and other services.

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implements secure user authentication and role-based access control for protecting sensitive resources.

- **Data Validation:** Validates incoming data to ensure data integrity and consistency.

- **Error Handling:** Implements comprehensive error handling and response codes to provide meaningful feedback to clients.

- **Logging:** Logs server activities and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

- **Caching:** Implements caching mechanisms to optimize performance for frequently requested data.

- **Background Jobs:** Supports background processing for tasks that can be deferred and executed asynchronously.

- **Scalability:** Designed with scalability in mind to handle increased traffic and growing user base.
